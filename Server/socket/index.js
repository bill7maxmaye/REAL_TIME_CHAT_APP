//in this index.js real time related codes are written  here like sending message from one user to the other(since our app is real time chat app). this real time related codes are all event driven. But on the controller folder non real time related functionalities of the server are handled(code of non realtime are handled there) like loging in

//In the provided server-side code, the event-driven code using Socket.io handles real-time communication between clients and the server. This typically involves actions like establishing connections, receiving and sending messages, managing user online status, and handling disconnections.

// On the other hand, the controller folder likely contains logic for handling HTTP requests and responses, which are not necessarily real-time and are usually initiated by client actions such as submitting a form or making an API call.

  // On the client side, when initiating the connection,
  //the client includes the authentication token like this:

  //create a room

  // The room is specific to each user and is identified by the user's unique ID. This allows the server to target messages to a particular user, regardless of how many devices or connections (sockets) they have. Each socket (representing a connection from a device) joins the same room for that user, enabling consistent and unified communication across all of the userâ€™s active connections.

  // This line makes the connected client join a specific room associated with the user's ID. In socket.io, rooms are used to group sockets that should receive the same messages.(sockets created by joining the same user from different devices or tabs) By joining a room named after the user's ID, you can easily send messages to that specific user later.

    //broadcasts an event named "onlineUser" to all connected clients, sending an array of user IDs that represent the currently online users. This allows all clients to stay updated on the list of users who are online.
    //Array.from(onlineUser) converts the onlineUser set into an array.
